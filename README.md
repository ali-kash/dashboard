# Admin Dashboard

- [View Live](https://dashboard-sandy-gamma-59.vercel.app/)

Created this project using some basic technology to showcase an admin dashboard. For the sake of time there is no user validation, but just a presentation of using modern day technologies to display multiple types of data.

Links in the sidebar navigation go to pages with specific content.

The content may include data tables, form, calendar, and various types of charts to showcase data.

### Contacts -

A data table that utilizes multiple built in data filters.

### Profile Form -

The form has validation using regex for some input fields. When submitting a valid form, the data will be displayed in the console.
